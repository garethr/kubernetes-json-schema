A path element refers is the\n  list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a\n  match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the\n  request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring\n  of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar\n  matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).\n* ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to\n  the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType\n  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.\nImplementations are required to support all path types.
